Story :Once upon a time there was a boy that had to do something important.
That important thing was so important that the importance of that important thing was important itself.

The end.

No i'm joking.
So anyways, the boy was doing that important thing that had such important importance, that a vortex was created and it was consuming all the importance around it.

Do you realize how important that was? It was so important, that it started becomming not so important.
The importance of that important thing overloaded from importance and it started becomming way less important.

After that, the boy looked at the clock, it was 4:20 and he was all like "hm... i guess i have nothing important to do, do i?"
Then the boy climbed the highest point of his house to enjoy the sunset.

Fin.
