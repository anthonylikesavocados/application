So here's the thing, 

I was applying for a job as PHP support and i was given the opportunity to show that i have a basic php writing knowledge.
I was told on friday, 10th of September and i had to do it ready for monday on 13th of September. That would mean, that i have to be done with it until 12th of September on sunday.

The project is relatively simple. You write information in the fields and that information is being saved on a file. Many people would wonder "Is that it?" and i'd be like: Yeah! since i haven't done a lot of php in the last months or even years and i cannot really be proud of myself as a senior software developer.

Although i am capable of projects a little bit more complicated than this, i didn't do anything more complicated because i want to be sure that i will finish the project until monday.

Better be safe than sorry.
... say people that are not really impressive with their php writing abilities.

Thanks.
With best regards,
Anthony Ivanov

p.s.
information is being written in text.txt, index.php is the page where the information is being imputted, php.php is a gate to that realm.
